# HELP DESK TICKETING SYSTEM PROTOTYPE

## A prototype project of code solutions for a Help Desk Ticketing System in Python

This project is a prototype built using an intergrated development enviroment of Visual Studio Code, the latest version of Python3 programming language along with my findings to apply code solutions in developing a Help Desk Ticketing System. The prototype is designed to manage the following ticketing processes of the help desk ticketing system:

* Submitting a ticket: Tickets can be submitted by providing staff members Staff ID, Name of the ticket creator, Contact email and the Description of the issue.
* Assigning a ticket number: Ticket numbers should be assigned automatically after the count of 2000.
* Responding to tickets: Respond to a ticket by providing a response after a ticket has been submitted.
* Generating new password: Generate a new password response following the rule of the first 2 characters of staff ID and first 3 characters of the name of the ticket creator if a ticket requires a password change.
* Statistics - Displaying and keeping a track of the number of tickets submitted, the number of tickets resolved and the number of open tickets.
* Displaying a ticket: A way to display ticket information of the ticket number, Name of ticket creator, Staff ID, Contact email, Description of the issue, Response from help desk and the status of the ticket.
